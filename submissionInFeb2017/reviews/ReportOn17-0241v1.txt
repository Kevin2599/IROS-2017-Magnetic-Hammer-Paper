The authors present a method to produce large pulsed forces on
millirobots with magnetic hammer actuation for tissue penetration,
which is much relevant to medical robotic applications. Overall, this
paper is well written and technologically sound. However, the reviewers
suggest corrections about a number of points that need clarifying such
as the purpose of study, the derivation of many equations, the method
of simulation and experiments. We request that you make major revisions
before it is processed further. Please read the review reports
carefully and revise the manuscript according to the reviewers'
comments.
