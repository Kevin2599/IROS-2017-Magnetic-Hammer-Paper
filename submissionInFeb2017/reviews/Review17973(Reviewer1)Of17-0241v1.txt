This paper deal with magnetic hammer actuation for tissue penetration.
Especially, this paper presents a method to produce large pulsed forces
on millirobots. The contents of this paper are as follows: concept of
the robot, mathematical model of magnetic hammer, analysis, preliminary
experiment. This paper consists of 6 chapters, 15 figures and 12
references. 

The concept of the system is interesting. However, clarity of
presentation and thoroughness of results are fair. Please see the
following major comments.

[major comment : clarity of presentation]
- The introduction of the each equation is not clear.Especially,
equation(3)-(8), (10)-(13).
- The method of the simulation or the experiment are not clearly
described in chapter II –V, respectively. 
- What is the difference about perfectly closed loop, open loop and
partially closed loop?
- What is the meaning of the following sentences “This is equivalent to
a perfectly closed-loop system where the gradient signal switches
direction when the sphere switches direction.”. Why?

[major comment : thoroughness of results]
-The method and result (especially, experiment part) does not support
your concept enough. The further implementation is needed to
demonstrate your idea about magnetic hammer.

[minor comment : clarity of presentation]
- There are many abbreviation, which is not introduced (ODE, FEMM,
etc). 
- What is desktop the experiments?
