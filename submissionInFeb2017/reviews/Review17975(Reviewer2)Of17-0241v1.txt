The paper describes simulation and experimental results for a device
consisting of a cylindrical tube with an internal impact plate and
external sharp point at one end, and an internal spring at the other
end, so that a spherical magnet inside the tube can be driven by an
oscillating magnetic field to generate impulsive forces at the pointed
end, so as to penetrate tissue.

The paper is well written and organized, and the subject matter is
novel and relevant to medical robot applications.  The following minor
revisions are requested for IROS and RA-L publication:
--Explain the derivation of equation (2)
--Clarify whether the rotation of the sphere is modeled in the dynamic
simulation
--State how the simulation was implemented, whether in a simulation
software such as Simulink/Simscape, or coded by the authors, or
otherwise.
--Fix P.5 right side "show that and that" error
--Give the supplier and specifications of the "Syren 25" power supply
--Section V:  Explain why MRI gradient frequencies other that 2 Hz were
not applied as in simulation
--Add discussion and modeling of the effects of air resistance on the
motion of the sphere in the tube
--What is the diameter, mass, and magnetization of the magnet used?
--How were the dimensions and other parameters of the device selected? 
Was any optimization procedure used in the design?
