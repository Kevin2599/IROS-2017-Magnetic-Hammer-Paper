\begin{abstract}

Untethered navigation of millirobots within a human body using an MRI scanner is a promising technology for minimally invasive surgery or drug delivery. However, the magnetic field and gradient values are too small to produce forces large enough to penetrate tissues. This paper presents a method to produce large pulsed forces on millirobots. A magnetic sphere is placed inside the robot body and can move back and forth. This movement is created by alternatively changing the gradient direction. On the aft side, a spring allows the sphere to change direction smoothly. On the forward side, a hard rod creates a surface for the sphere to impact. This impact results in a large pulsed force. This system has first been modeled and simulated. Different control strategies are presented and experimentally tested. Finally, the system was tested to penetrate artificial tissues.

\section{CONCLUSIONS}


\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
